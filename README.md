## Evolutionary Generative (EvoGen) Art Circles.

## Summary
Strating with two circles that have 4 variable features I generate X number children using random results that fall within the values of the parent circles.
Then for each subsequent generation I may assign a weighting factor to the randominzation based on precedding results.

## Variables
#1 - Primary Hue and it's resulting split complimentary colors
#2 - StrokeWeight
#3 - Inner Circle Size
#4 - Inner Circle Position


This is also a projecty to to learn about p5.js and more about VS Code, Git, and Javascript.

## Random Notes


*This project was a little inspired by CryptoKitties. Meow.
